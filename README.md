# Browser Tracking Prevention - Blocked Form Alerts

> **As originally published at [insiteful.co/help/fix-tracking-prevention-forms](https://insiteful.co/help/fix-tracking-prevention-forms)**

Simple, lightweight script to alert users when browser tracking prevention is blocking your embedded forms.

## Overview

As the eternal war between digital advertising and privacy continues to evolve, so have browser-based tracking prevention tools. Today, browsers like Microsoft Edge and Firefox include built-in tracking prevention that is enabled by default for users.

Many form builder tools (like [HubSpot Forms](https://insiteful.co/help/form-tracking/hubspot-forms/?ref=github&utm_content=tracking-prev-readme) and [Typeform](https://insiteful.co/help/form-tracking/typeform/?ref=github&utm_content=tracking-prev-readme)) rely on JavaScript codes to embed their forms on your website.

If your visitors have tracking prevention enabled in their browser, they may visit your lead forms and see absolutely nothing. The greatest risk here is that tracking prevention doesn't include any error message, so **users only see a blank page and assume your website is broken**.

With Firefox and Microsoft Edge combining for approximately 8-10% of the browser market share, companies could be losing 5-8% of potential conversions without even realizing they have a form visibility problem.

## Installation
You can install these codes by copying and pasting the script directly into your site, or by using the URL hosted on Insiteful.co, as seen below:
